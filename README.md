Project brief for project 1, 2, 3 and 4: As part of a UX design team at a consultancy, you are tasked with designing a digital restaurant management system for a family-owned restaurant expanding to two new locations. Currently, the restaurant operates using paper-based methods for table management, order-taking, and kitchen communication, which are inefficient for larger establishments. The goal is to modernize operations by introducing a digital system that automates key processes while preserving certain traditional elements, such as greeting customers at the door. The new system will allow hosts to check table status digitally, enable wait staff to enter orders electronically, and provide kitchen staff with real-time order tracking. Bus staff will also have access to live updates on table cleanliness and occupancy, and all restaurant data will be systematically stored for management review and analysis. This project aims to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance the overall dining experience.

Project 1: For Assignment 1, We will conduct user research to identify the needs, goals, and pain points of restaurant staff, management, and customers. This will involve performing a stakeholder analysis, observing or role-playing restaurant operations, and defining key challenges within the current system. Our research will help uncover inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement, ensuring that the new digital system effectively addresses the restaurant’s operational needs. To document our findings, we will compile a one-page brainstorming document that outlines the identified problems, summarizes brainstorming sessions, answers key questions about stakeholders and system functions, and includes a user story. Additionally, we will highlight the added value and sustainability of my proposed solution. The final deliverable for this assignment will be a 1–2 page user research report that details stakeholder insights, pain points, and a well-defined problem statement, which will serve as the foundation for designing and developing the digital restaurant management system.

Project 2: In this assignment, we built on our user research report from Assignment 1 by progressing to the ideation and wireframing stages of your design project. The goal was to brainstorm and develop low-fidelity wireframes for the new system, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly experience. We began by exploring various interface designs for different system functions, using these ideas to create initial wireframes that visually represent the layout and structure. Additionally, we developed a user flow diagram to map out the steps a user will take to navigate through the system. This process helped to refine our design concepts, improving usability and clarity. The final deliverable was a wireframe and UX flow document containing sketches, low-fidelity wireframes, and a user flow diagram.

Project 3: For this assignment, we will build on the work we completed in Assignments 1 and 2 to create high-fidelity wireframes that simulate my digital restaurant management system. These wireframes will provide a detailed and polished representation of the system’s interface, ensuring it is both visually appealing and user-friendly. By refining our low-fidelity wireframes and incorporating feedback from the previous stages, we will develop a more accurate and interactive design that closely resembles the final product. In addition to the high-fidelity wireframes, we will submit a document summarizing the work we have done so far.

Project 4: For the final part of the assignment, we will refine my interactive high-fidelity prototypes, building on the work from previous submissions to create a polished and user-friendly digital system. We will present the interactive prototype, demonstrating the user experience, functionality, and design decisions that make the system intuitive and efficient. This final presentation will highlight our ability to design a seamless digital solution tailored to the restaurant’s needs. As part of the deliverables, we will provide a link to the interactive prototype (created in Figma) and submit a PDF or PowerPoint deck summarizing key points. 

For each project we were only given 5 days, making the time constraints tight.
